# Tech Stack Recommendation for Project Setup Script

**Project:** Vibe Coding Project Setup Script (as described in `01-product-design-document.md`)

---

## Recommended Tech Stack

*   **Language:** **Python 3**
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Simplicity:** Clear syntax, easy to use for scripting.
        *   **Robust Standard Library:** Excellent built-in modules (`os`, `pathlib`) for cross-platform file system operations and user input (`input()`), making external dependencies unnecessary for the core functionality.
        *   **Cross-Platform:** Runs consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Frontend:** Not Applicable (Command-line interface)
*   **Backend:** Not Applicable (Local script)
*   **Database:** Not Applicable (No persistent data storage needed)
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks:** Python Standard Library only.

**Note:** This tech stack is for the *setup script itself*. The tech stack for the actual application you intend to build *using* this script will be determined later and documented in the `memory-bank/02-tech-stack.md` file created by the script, based on that application's specific `01-product-design-document.md`.
