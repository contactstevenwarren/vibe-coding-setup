# Design Document: Project Templates Feature

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for adding an optional "Project Templates" feature to the `vibe-coding-setup` script. The script will always generate the standard base structure (including `memory-bank` and `.cursor/rules` directories with their default content). This feature allows users to optionally select one or more predefined additional templates during the setup process, enabling the script to layer on extra files or configurations (like specific AI instructions) for a more tailored starting point.

## 2. Goals

*   Allow users to choose a specific project template during setup.
*   Provide a mechanism to define and manage different project templates.
*   Generate project structures and files specific to the selected template.
*   Maintain the core Vibe Coding principles while offering more specialized starting points.

## 3. Non-Goals

*   Dynamically fetching templates from external sources (initially).
*   Allowing users to define custom templates via the command line during setup.
*   Complex dependency management or package installation as part of template application (initially).

## 4. User Flow Changes

The user interaction sequence will be modified as follows:

1.  **Run Script:** User executes `vibe-coding-setup`.
2.  **Project Name:** Script prompts for "Project Name". (No change)
3.  **Project Description:** Script prompts for "Brief Project Description". (No change)
4.  **Optional Template Selection:**
    *   The script informs the user about optional templates: "The following optional templates can add specific instructions to the base setup:"
    *   It displays a numbered list of available *additional* templates (e.g., "1. Add: Laravel with Supabase Auth Instructions").
    *   The script prompts the user: "Select template numbers to apply (comma-separated, e.g., 1), or press Enter to continue with base structure only:"
    *   User enters a comma-separated list of numbers (e.g., `1`, or potentially `1,2` in the future) or simply presses Enter.
    *   Input validation ensures any entered numbers are valid selections from the list. Empty input is valid.
5.  **Generation:** The script always generates the base project structure and files first. If the user entered template numbers, it then layers on the additional files/configurations from those selected templates based on a defined strategy. If the user pressed Enter, only the base structure is generated.
6.  **Post-Execution:** Post-execution instructions might be slightly adapted based on whether additional templates were applied.

## 5. Template Definition and Structure

The base Vibe Coding structure (memory-bank, .cursor/rules with default content) is always generated. Templates defined here represent *optional additions* to that base. **Crucially, these additions primarily consist of instructional files placed within the `.cursor/rules` directory. These instructions guide the user (and potentially the AI assistant) on how to set up, configure, or use the specific technology or feature associated with the template.** While templates *can* include other boilerplate files or directories, the main purpose is to inject relevant guidance into the project's AI context.

Templates will be defined internally within the Python script initially for simplicity.

*Initial Scope:* For the first implementation, we will define:
*   The implicit "Base Vibe Coding Structure" (applied when the user presses Enter at the template prompt).
*   One specific additional template: "Laravel with Supabase Auth Instructions" (selected via '1').

Each additional template definition should include:

*   **`id`:** A unique identifier (e.g., `base`, `laravel-supabase`, `php-composer`).
*   **`name`:** A user-friendly name for display (e.g., "Base Vibe Coding Structure", "Laravel with Supabase Auth").
*   **`description`:** A brief description (optional, for future use).
*   **`files`:** A dictionary or list defining the files and their content (or content generation logic) specific to this template. **This primarily involves adding instruction files (e.g., `.mdc`) to the `.cursor/rules` directory.** It can also include other configuration or boilerplate files if necessary.
*   **`directories`:** A list of directories specific to this template (beyond the default `memory-bank` and `.cursor`). This is less common, as templates focus on adding instructions.

**Example (Conceptual - Initial Implementation):**

```python
# Represents the base structure generation logic (always runs)
def generate_base_structure(root_dir, project_name, project_description):
    # ... logic to create memory-bank, .cursor/rules and default files ...
    pass

# Defines optional additional templates
ADDITIONAL_TEMPLATES = [
    # No entry needed for index 0, as it signifies "apply base only"
    {
        "id": "laravel-supabase",
        "name": "1. Add: Laravel with Supabase Auth Instructions",
        "directories": [], # No *additional* directories beyond base
        "files": {
            # This template primarily adds specific instructions via a new rule.
            # The goal is to guide the setup of Laravel with Supabase.
            # Base memory-bank files are generated as usual by generate_base_structure.
            # Base .cursor/rules files are generated as usual by generate_base_structure.
            ".cursor/rules/05-laravel-supabase-setup.mdc": get_laravel_supabase_setup_instructions,
        }
    },
    # Add more templates here in the future, index starting from the next number
    # {
    #    "id": "php-composer",
    #    "name": "2. Add: Base PHP Composer Project Files",
    #    ...
    # }
]
```

*Note: The example above uses a list for `ADDITIONAL_TEMPLATES`. The selection logic will map the user's input number (e.g., '1') to the corresponding item in the list (e.g., index 0). Pressing Enter results in an empty selection.* 

**Conflict Resolution (for future multi-select):** If multiple *additional* templates are selected and define the same file or directory, a strategy is needed. Potential options:
*   **Error:** Disallow conflicting selections.
*   **Prioritize:** Last selected template's version wins.
*   **Merge:** Attempt to merge content (complex, potentially format-specific).
*(Decision deferred until multiple conflicting templates are actually implemented)*.

## 6. Implementation Changes (High-Level)

*   **`vibe-coding-setup` (Main Script):**
    *   Define the `ADDITIONAL_TEMPLATES` data structure (initially with the laravel one).
    *   Add a function `select_additional_templates()` to display options and get user input (handling Enter for none, and comma-separated lists). Validate the input, returning a list of selected template definitions.
    *   Modify the main execution flow to call `generate_base_structure` first, then call a new function `apply_additional_templates(selected_templates, ...)` if the selection list is not empty.
*   **Directory/File Creation Functions:**
    *   `generate_base_structure` encapsulates all the original directory/file creation logic.
    *   `apply_additional_templates` iterates through the selected templates and creates any *additional* specified directories and files (primarily instruction files in `.cursor/rules`), handling potential future conflicts.
*   **Content Generation:**
    *   Existing content generation logic might need to be refactored into functions that can be called by different template definitions (e.g., `get_base_prd_content`).
    *   Add new functions or constants for template-specific content, **especially for generating the `.cursor/rules` instruction files.**

This design provides a foundation for the templates feature, starting with an internal definition and focusing on modifying the generation logic based on user selection, with an emphasis on providing setup instructions.
