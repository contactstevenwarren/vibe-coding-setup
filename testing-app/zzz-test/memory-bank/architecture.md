# System Architecture Overview

**Project:** zzz test

---
**Instructions for Use:**

As your AI coding assistant (e.g., Claude in Cursor) creates files, components, database schemas, or important data structures, document their purpose and how they interact here. This serves as a living reference for both you and the AI. Update this regularly, especially after adding major features or making significant architectural changes.

**Example Sections:**
*   File/Component Index (`path/to/file.ext`: Purpose)
*   Data Structures / Schema (Database tables, API interfaces, key state objects)
*   Diagrams (Consider adding Mermaid diagrams later: `https://mermaid.js.org/`)

*(Delete these instructions before starting to document the architecture)*
