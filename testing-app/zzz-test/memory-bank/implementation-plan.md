# Implementation Plan

**Project:** zzz test

---
**Instructions for Generation:**

Use an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Provide the LLM with both your `product-requirements-document.md` and `tech-stack.md`. Each step should be small, specific, testable, and focus on building the core functionality first.

**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the attached Product Requirements Document (`product-requirements-document.md`) and Tech Stack (`tech-stack.md`) for my project 'zzz test', please generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Break down the core functionality into small, manageable steps. For each step, describe the task and suggest a simple test to verify its completion. Focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first."

*(Attach or paste the content of both `.md` files when prompting. Delete these instructions once the plan is generated)*
