**Instructions for Use:**

As you complete steps from the `implementation-plan.md` using your AI coding assistant (e.g., Claude in Cursor), document the completed step, the date, and any relevant details (like the commit hash) here. This helps track progress and provides context for future work.

**Format:**
*   **[YYYY-MM-DD] - Step X: [Description of Step Completed]** - (Commit: `[hash]`, Notes: [Optional notes])
