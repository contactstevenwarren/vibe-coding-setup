# Tech Stack Recommendations

**Project:** zzz-new

---
**Instructions for Generation:**

Use an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to recommend a suitable tech stack for your project. Provide the LLM with the content of your `product-requirements-document.md`. Ask for the simplest yet most robust stack possible for your requirements.

**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the attached Product Requirements Document (`product-requirements-document.md`) for my project 'zzz-new', please recommend the simplest yet most robust tech stack. Consider frontend, backend (if applicable), database, and any key libraries or frameworks. Explain the reasoning behind your choices."

*(Attach or paste the content of `product-requirements-document.md` when prompting. Delete these instructions once the tech stack is defined)*
