**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the following initial description for my project 'zzz-new', please help me create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Initial Description: 'test desc'
Please include sections for: Overview, Core Features (with brief descriptions), Target Audience, User Stories (at least 3-5 examples), and Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., performance, security)."
