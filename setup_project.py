**Project:** {project_name}

*Initial Description Provided During Setup:*

**Instructions for Generation:**

Use an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to flesh out this PRD based on your initial description. Provide the initial description and ask the LLM to expand on it, defining core features, target audience, user stories, and any non-functional requirements.

**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the following initial description for my project '{project_name}', please help me create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
Initial Description: '{project_description}'
Please include sections for: Overview, Core Features (with brief descriptions), Target Audience, User Stories (at least 3-5 examples), and Non-Functional Requirements (e.g., performance, security)."

"""

TECH_STACK_TEMPLATE = """# Tech Stack Recommendations

**Project:** {project_name}

---
**Instructions for Generation:**

Use an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to recommend a suitable tech stack for your project. Provide the LLM with the content of your `product-requirements-document.md`. Ask for the simplest yet most robust stack possible for your requirements.

**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the attached Product Requirements Document (`product-requirements-document.md`) for my project '{project_name}', please recommend the simplest yet most robust tech stack. Consider frontend, backend (if applicable), database, and any key libraries or frameworks. Explain the reasoning behind your choices."

"""

IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE = """# Implementation Plan

**Project:** {project_name}

---
**Instructions for Generation:**

Use an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Provide the LLM with both your `product-requirements-document.md` and `tech-stack.md`. Each step should be small, specific, testable, and focus on building the core functionality first.

**Example Prompt for LLM:**
"Based on the attached Product Requirements Document (`product-requirements-document.md`) and Tech Stack (`tech-stack.md`) for my project '{project_name}', please generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan. Break down the core functionality into small, manageable steps. For each step, describe the task and suggest a simple test to verify its completion. Focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first."

**Project:** {project_name}

---
**Instructions for Use:**

As you complete steps from the `implementation-plan.md` using your AI coding assistant (e.g., Claude in Cursor), document the completed step, the date, and any relevant details (like the commit hash) here. This helps track progress and provides context for future work.

**Format:**
*   **[YYYY-MM-DD] - Step X: [Description of Step Completed]** - (Commit: `[hash]`, Notes: [Optional notes])

**Instructions for Use:**

As your AI coding assistant (e.g., Claude in Cursor) creates files, components, database schemas, or important data structures, document their purpose and how they interact here. This serves as a living reference for both you and the AI. Update this regularly, especially after adding major features or making significant architectural changes.

**Example Sections:**
*   File/Component Index (`path/to/file.ext`: Purpose)
*   Data Structures / Schema (Database tables, API interfaces, key state objects)
*   Diagrams (Consider adding Mermaid diagrams later: `https://mermaid.js.org/`)

Next Steps:

1.  **Open the project folder in Cursor:**
    cd {project_name}
    cursor .
2.  **Generate Memory Bank Content:**
    *   Open `memory-bank/product-requirements-document.md`. Follow the instructions inside to generate the content using an LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Pro).
    *   Open `memory-bank/tech-stack.md`. Follow the instructions inside, using your PRD, to generate the content.
    *   Open `memory-bank/implementation-plan.md`. Follow the instructions inside, using your PRD and tech stack, to generate the plan.
3.  **Review and Refine Cursor Rules:**
    *   Open `.cursor/rules`. A boilerplate file has been created based on the Vibe Coding guide.
    *   **Crucially:** Review these rules. Adjust triggers (e.g., "Always" vs "Default") as needed.
    *   Add rules specific to your chosen tech stack and project requirements.
    *   You can also use the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command in Cursor (Command Palette -> "Configure Rules for '.cursor'") to potentially add more rules based on your memory bank files, then merge/refine.
4.  **Start Coding with Claude:**
    *   Open `memory-bank/architecture.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` and remove the initial instruction blocks.
    *   Use Claude Sonnet 3.7 in Cursor: Read all the documents in /memory-bank, is implementation-plan.md clear? What are your questions to make it 100% clear for you?
    *   Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking in Cursor: Read all the documents in /memory-bank, and proceed with Step 1 of the implementation plan. I will run the tests. Do not start Step 2 until I validate the tests. Once I validate them, open progress.md and document what you did for future developers. Then add any architectural insights to architecture.md to explain what each file does. And finally use Git for version control (`git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial setup"`).
    *   Continue workflow: Now go through all files in the memory-bank, read progress.md to understand prior work, and proceed with Step 2. Do not start Step 3 until I validate the test. Repeat this process until the entire implementation-plan.md is complete.


Happy Vibe Coding!
