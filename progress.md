# Project Progress Tracker

**Project:** Vibe Coding Project Setup Script

## Completed Steps

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 1: Initialize Script File** - Created the main Python script file with basic structure and imported the pathlib module. Created and ran tests to verify it executes without errors.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 2: Get Project Name** - Implemented code to prompt the user for a project name using the input() function, with validation to ensure the name is not empty. Added tests to verify functionality.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 3: Get Project Description** - Implemented code to prompt the user for a project description. Added tests to verify functionality.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 4: Create Root Project Directory** - Implemented functionality to create the root project directory based on the project name, with error handling for existing directories. Added tests to verify the directory is created correctly and appropriate errors are raised when needed.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 5: Create Subdirectories** - Implemented functionality to create the memory-bank and .cursor subdirectories within the root project directory. Added tests to verify the subdirectories are created correctly.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 6: Define Boilerplate Content Templates** - Defined string constants for all required template files including product-requirements-document.md, tech-stack.md, implementation-plan.md, progress.md, architecture.md, and .cursor/rules. Used Python-style placeholders for project_name and project_description. Created and ran tests to verify template formatting.

* **[2024-07-29] - Improvement: Project Name Sanitization** - Added functionality to sanitize project names by converting spaces to hyphens and removing special characters. This ensures project directories are terminal and filesystem friendly. The user is notified when sanitization occurs.

## Next Steps

* Step 7: Create and Populate memory-bank Files
* Step 8: Create and Populate .cursor/rules File
* Step 9: Print Post-Execution Instructions
* Step 10: Code Cleanup and Comments
