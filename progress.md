# Project Progress Tracker

**Project:** Vibe Coding Project Setup Script

## Completed Steps

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 1: Initialize Script File** - Created the main Python script file with basic structure and imported the pathlib module. Created and ran tests to verify it executes without errors.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 2: Get Project Name** - Implemented code to prompt the user for a project name using the input() function, with validation to ensure the name is not empty. Added tests to verify functionality.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 3: Get Project Description** - Implemented code to prompt the user for a project description. Added tests to verify functionality.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 4: Create Root Project Directory** - Implemented functionality to create the root project directory based on the project name, with error handling for existing directories. Added tests to verify the directory is created correctly and appropriate errors are raised when needed.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 5: Create Subdirectories** - Implemented functionality to create the memory-bank and .cursor subdirectories within the root project directory. Added tests to verify the subdirectories are created correctly.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 6: Define Boilerplate Content Templates** - Defined string constants for all required template files including product-requirements-document.md, tech-stack.md, implementation-plan.md, progress.md, architecture.md, and .cursor/rules. Used Python-style placeholders for project_name and project_description. Created and ran tests to verify template formatting.

* **[2024-07-29] - Improvement: Project Name Sanitization** - Added functionality to sanitize project names by converting spaces to hyphens and removing special characters. This ensures project directories are terminal and filesystem friendly. The user is notified when sanitization occurs.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 7: Create and Populate memory-bank Files** - Implemented functionality to create and populate the five required Markdown files in the memory-bank directory (product-requirements-document.md, tech-stack.md, implementation-plan.md, progress.md, and architecture.md) with appropriate template content. Added tests to verify that files are created correctly and contain the right content.

* **[2024-07-29] - Improvement: Human-Readable Names in Content** - Modified the code to use the original, human-readable project name in file content while using the sanitized name for directories and file paths. This ensures that directories work well with command line tools but displayed content is more user-friendly.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 8: Create and Populate .cursor/rules File** - Implemented functionality to create and populate the .cursor/rules file with boilerplate Cursor rules based on the Vibe Coding methodology. Added tests to verify the file is created correctly and contains the expected content.

* **[2024-07-29] - Improvement: MDC-Formatted Cursor Rules** - Updated the Cursor rules implementation to follow best practices from the Cursor documentation. Instead of a single rules file, now creates multiple focused MDC rule files with proper metadata in a `rules` directory. This aligns with Cursor's recommended approach for project rules.

* **[2024-07-29] - Step 9: Print Post-Execution Instructions** - Implemented functionality to format and print post-execution instructions to the user after creating the project structure. The instructions guide the user on how to open the project in Cursor, generate content for the memory bank files, review and refine the Cursor rules, and start coding with Claude.

* **[2024-07-29] - Improvement: CLI-Friendly Post-Execution Instructions** - Redesigned the post-execution instructions for better terminal readability, using ASCII dividers and clearer formatting. Updated the prompts to match exactly what's in MANUAL-VIBE-CODING.md, making them easier to copy and paste without modifications. Added clear instructions about selecting Claude Sonnet 3.7 and the workflow between steps.

* **[2024-07-30] - Step 10: Code Cleanup and Comments** - Completed a comprehensive review of the codebase. Added appropriate comments, improved code organization, and implemented best practices for maintainability. Ensured consistent docstrings for all functions and improved variable naming for clarity.

* **[2024-07-30] - Step 12: Documentation** - Created comprehensive documentation for the project. Added a main README.md file in the root directory and detailed documentation in the docs/ directory, including usage guides and explanation of the Vibe Coding methodology. Updated architecture.md with detailed system architecture information.

## In Progress

* **[2024-07-30] - Step 11: Final Testing** - Conducting comprehensive testing of the script in various environments to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Next Steps

* Step 13: Package and Distribution Setup
